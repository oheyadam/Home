# Home üê∂

Home is a small application that lets you search for dogs by breed, and click a dog to see 
some details about it.

## Project Details ‚öôÔ∏è

* 100% Kotlin
* Modern architecture (Multi-module setup, MVI, Single-Activity, Compose, Hilt)
* Gradle convention plugins
* The Square buffet

## How Do I Navigate This Project?

Home relies on [Gradle Convention Plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_convention_plugins.html) to make it easy to add new modules. You can start in the `build-logic` module to see how this works.

The `core-common` module has some shared functionality that can be used across the app, `core-model` is where the domain models live, `core-network` is where all the Remote data plumbing lives. 

`library-data` is where you'll see some work being done. The `BreedRemoteSource` lives there, which you can use to perform network requests.

`library-analytics` is where analytics wrappers live. Currently, only [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) is added to this project.

`feature-list` is a UI module. It has the Search/List feature that you see when you first open the app, and its UI is written in XML.

`feature-detail` is a UI module. It has the detail view that you're taken to when you select a search result, and its UI is written fully in Jetpack Compose.

## Future Plans / What Would I Do Differently? ‚è≥

This is a live document, so these thoughts might change in the future.

- I'd like to split the `core-common` module into smaller modules. Currently, logic inside it is
separated by package, which is good enough at the moment, but can be worth revisiting in the future.
- I'd like to explore making this app work offline
- Add UI / Snapshot tests
- Explore more complex UIs in Compose
- Add animations for transitions from List to Detail

## Acknowledgments & Inspiration
Some aspects of the code are inspired by open source community contributions and blog posts.

- The tooling and `build-logic` is inspired by both [this](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/herding-elephants/) blog post and [NowInAndroid](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid)
- The `core-network` module takes inspiration from [this](https://github.com/skydoves/retrofit-adapters) library
- The use of Dagger multibinding to wire up the `library-analytics` module is inspired by [this](https://adambennett.dev/2021/03/intoset-dagger-multibindings-and-architecture/) blog post
